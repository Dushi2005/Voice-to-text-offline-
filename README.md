Voice-to-Text Note Taker (Offline)

This project is an offline Python-based voice note taker that converts spoken audio into text using the SpeechRecognition library with the CMU Sphinx engine. It captures audio through the microphone, transcribes it locally without requiring internet, and automatically saves each note as a timestamped .txt file for easy retrieval. The system is lightweight, fast, and ideal for productivity, accessibility, and offline environments.
